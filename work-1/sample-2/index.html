    <div><h2>Envisioning Design</h2></div>
    <p>Below is an essay about my initial ideas and plans for the design and use of this website.</p>
    <p><b>Original:</b></p>
    <p>The general concept that I want to use for my website is “simple”.  I don’t want there to be much
      to the website alone, and I want it to be as simple and easy to navigate as possible.  I want a 
      general color scheme of black and white, but with red highlights where possible, or maybe blue.  
      I want the color to really stand out, but not be overwhelming.  I hope to use this website as a 
      place to store a bunch of projects that I’ve done in this class, in others, and outside of school.  
      The main focus should then be on the creations themselves, but of course I want it to still look good, 
      because the website is a project itself.<br>
	    The parts of a website that are engaging are not just the contents, but how the contents are presented.  
      If you want to show a bunch of YouTube videos, it might be better to embed them and take care of how much 
      you use, instead of just using a list of links.  Embedding these videos would keep the user on one single 
      page, making the website a lot less complex.  I don’t know how to create the perfect design of a website, 
      but I do know what to avoid.  Overwhelming the user with too many graphics, words, links, and navigation 
      options lead to a mess that the user can’t deal with easily.  That is why I hope to create a simple, almost 
      minimalist website interface.</p>
