    <h2>Embedded Fiction Writing</h2>
    <p>The following is a piece of embedded writing; a fake amazon.com review for the product in the link below.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zelda-Master-Twilight-Princess-Links/dp/B00J3ZLBME/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=nerf+sword&qid=1578515227&sr=8-6">Zelda Master Twilight Princess Link's 42" Sword All Foam</a></p>

    <p>I have recently been having trouble with a local wild hog that has been terrorizing my property.  My children have been calling it Ganon, after some pig
      from some video game, and they told me you had to buy this sword to beat it.<br>
So I bought this sword, but when I went to kill the hog the sword just bounced off and the hog broke my legs.<br>
My kids then told me that it’s not at full power yet, and I need to go on a “mini-quest” to unlock the power inside it.
      When I asked them how to start it, they said it should start when I first got the sword!<br>
I can’t believe Nerf and Amazon would have the audacity to sell such a sword!  It’s not even completed yet, but it
      doesn’t say that anywhere on this website!  They don’t even have the option of purchasing this “mini-quest” separately!<br>
DON’T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</p>
