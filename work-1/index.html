    <div><h2>Work in Progress 1</h2></div>
    <p>I have learned quite a bit about what I've wanted to do for this website. My original idea has not changed that much,
      but I've now spent a lot of time figuring out <em>why</em> I wanted to design it this way. From the start, my
      assignments in this class have been somewhat personal.</p>
    <p>For the first assignment, the Embedded Fiction, I wrote a fake Amazon product
      review for a Nerf foam sword based of of the Master Sword from one of my favorite video game series, the Legend of Zelda.
      It was almost reflex that when quickly asked to write something I went for something that already meant something to 
      me personally.</p>
    <p>For the second assignment, and this one, where I planned, designed, and implemented this website, I also
      went for a personal favorite: this color scheme. These three colors in conjunction are in my opinion the best to look
      at. So, this color scheme was kind of the first thing I decided on. More specifically from there, I wanted to go with
      the theme of using red as an accent to make it stand out. I could have used red and white with a black accent, or red
      and black with a white accent, but along with making it easier to read, this organization is the best for making the
      accent <strong>pop</strong>. As I explained in the second assignment, I want to make the content itself stand out, and
      this website to be more of a hub than an attraction.</p>
    <p>When actually creating this website, I put more thought into not just the color scheme, but the fonts. I realized that
      the fonts make much more of a difference than I initially thought. For the heading, I wanted to emphasize the title of
      my website not just with size, but by making the font in small-caps. I also then used the border to make it seem a
      little three-dimensional. On the other hand, for the main content font, I wanted to use something "softer".  This is
      another effort to make it seem more personal, instead of the classwork/research paper font of Times New Roman.</p>
    <p>I've also revised both my <i>About Me</i> and Design Concepts works to be more specific, because I want to be more
      clear about what I want, both for my professor and for me, because the clearer I am the more I can do to reach my 
      goals. In this effort, I have put a lot of work into getting the very specific look that I want. Owing to both my
      specific ideas and the fact that I am new to HTML and CSS, by the time I finish this Work in Progress assignment,
      I will have over 200 commits on GitHub. This is mostly just due to me forgetting that it'd be easier to test in
      Inspect Element first, and trying to make small changes over and over again, but I know that fine-tuning a website
      is really important. Personally, if I notice one thing that doesn't "fit" in a website, it takes all of my attention
      and I can never forget about it. I've tried my best to iron out the wrinkles of this website so far, and if I notice 
      anything new I will be sure to do some more tweaking.</p>
    <p>Something that I am looking forward to learning in the future of this class is photo editing with Photoshop, and
      more specifically learning how to use layers to create look effects like the illusion of three dimensions. I have often
      tried to mess around with Microsoft Paint, and while I feel like I could get the hang of it I think Photoshop just has
      so much more to offer. I feel like at the very least adequate Photoshop skills are going to be necessary in today's work
      environments, espescially for a Digital Narrative and Interactive Design major. I am also quite interested in learning
      how to edit video, understanding things like audio mixing and using green-screen especially, although I am not sure if
      that will be shown in this class. I am a frequent viewer of YouTube, and as many other viewers could tell you most content
      creators there talk all the time about editing their videos, and how long it takes for everybody. As YouTube is growing
      every day, I feel like editing ability is becoming a more common skill, and I don't want to be left behind. I am not
      entirely sure how I could implement these skills into this website, but I don't know much about Work-in-Progress 2 yet,
      so I guess I'll have to see.</p>
