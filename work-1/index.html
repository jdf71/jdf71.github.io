    <p>I have learned quite a bit about what I've wanted to do for this website. My original idea has not changed that much,
      but I've now spent a lot of time figuring out <em>why</em> I wanted to design it this way. From the start, my
      assignments in this class have been somewhat personal.</p>
    <p>For the first assignment, the Embedded Fiction, I wrote a fake Amazon product
      review for a Nerf foam sword based of of the Master Sword from one omy favorite video game series, the Legend of Zelda.
      It was almost reflex that when quickly asked to write something I went for something that already meant something to 
      me personally.</p>
    <p>For the second assignment, and this one, where I planned, designed, and implemented this website, I also
      went for a personal favorite: this color scheme. These three colors in conjunction are in my opinion the best to look
      at. So, this color scheme was kind of the first thing I decided on. More specifically from there, I wanted to go with
      the theme of using red as an accent to make it stand out. I could have used red and white with a black accent, or red
      and black with a white accent, but along with making it easier to read, this organization is the best for making the
      accent <strong>pop</strong>. As I explained in the second assignment, I want to make the content itself stand out, and
      this website to be more of a hub than an atrraction.</p>
    <p>When actually creating this website, I put more thought into not just the color scheme, but the fonts. I realized that
      the fonts make much more of a difference than I initially thought. For the heading, I wanted to emphasize the title of
      my website not just with size, but by making the font in small-caps. I also then used the border to make it seem a
      little three-dimensional. On the other hand, for the main content font, I wanted to use something "softer".  This is
      another effort to make it seem more personal, instead of the classwork/research paper font of Times New Roman.</p>
