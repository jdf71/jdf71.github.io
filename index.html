      <div><h2>About Me</h2></div>
       <p>My name is Joshua Ford, and I was born and raised in the small town of 
        Ebensburg, Pennsylvania.  I am interested in video games, the creation of 
        them, and how players and creators interact with them.</p>
       <p>I am a Digital Narrative and Interactive Design major
        at the University of Pittsburgh, with a planned graduation 
        date of spring 2021.<br>At the time of writing, I am taking a course 
        called Composing Digital Media.  In this class, I am going 
        to be learning about how to compose many forms of media,
        including using HTML to create this website.<br>
        Projects that I complete will be added to the website as I complete them.</p>
      <p>As I continue to learn more, I may continue to update this website with 
       projects, both from future classes and past ones. If this ends up being the case, 
       I will update this <i>About Me</i> section.<br>As this site is directly 
       connected to my official University of Pittsburgh email, it probably wonâ€™t 
       become a personal creativity project.  Although, if I end up making a separate 
       site for that reason, I will most likely add a link to it here as a personal project.</p>
