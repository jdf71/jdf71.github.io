       <p>For an instance of visual choices I have made throughout this class, I am going to try something
          more unique. Instead of using an example of a Photoshop assignment, using a completely visual
          medium, I am going to point out the very text you are reading.  The font used on these pages
          was chosen to fulfill a very specific purpose. As stated in several earlier assignments, I wanted
          this website to feel mostly professional, but with a personal touch. This font is a standard type
          of font, but it is slightly "softer". and easier to look at. Personally, my favorite font is Ubuntu,
          but especially considering this isn't a website focused on tech or coding, I felt it wasn't the right choice.
          This font, however, is close enough to remind me of that font while still fitting my thematic ideas.</p>

        <img height="800px" width="600px" class="logo" src="../static/images/Storyboard_2.png"/>
       </div>
       <p>Creating these storyboards was kind of frustrating to me at first, not because of putting together and 
          editing the images, but because of the template I used to start. For this assignment, we were given an
          opportunity to begin with a storyboard template, and fill in our work. Having not worked with someone
          else's photoshop files before, it was a bit of an issue to figure out everything. The templates were of
          course made to be edited, and so the layers were all organized in a certain way, and there were even some
          layers that were invisible, and optional to use. This is a great way to create a template, but it started
          to become pretty annoying to figure out where my new layers should go, and particularly how to edit the text.</p>

       <p>This final sample of my work is something that I am definitely quite proud of. This is at the end of 
         this Composing Digital Media class' work with Photoshop, and I believe it is among my best in terms of not
         just Photoshop, but image editing in general, especially given the limitations of Microsoft Paint.
         I feel like this is such a good display of my work because even though it isn't perfect, it is something
         that I feel at least resembles professional work.  I see a lot of modern logos being quite minimalist,
         such as Facebook's simple "f" and Twitter's single blue bird. I am also quite fond of the Cathedral of 
         Learning, and often think about it as the best symbol of Pitt. So, with those aspects combined, I feel
         like this logo in particular is some of my best work.</p>
