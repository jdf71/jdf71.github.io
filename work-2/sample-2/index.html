    <div><h2>Poster Genre Change</h2></div>
    <p>For the second assignment in Photoshop, we were split into groups to change the design of a movie poster in order to make
    it seem like it was another genre of movie.  We were randomly assigned the Comedy genre to choose our first movie from, and our
    group decided to use the movie poster for <i>Step Brothers</i>. We were then purposefully given the Superhero movie genre to
    change our poster into. As a group, we decided we would change the bodies of two two actors, Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, 
    into those of Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston respectfully. We chose these actors because they play Thor and Loki in the
    Marvel Cinematic Universe, whoc are in fact step brothers.</p>
