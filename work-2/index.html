    <div><h2>Photoshop</h2></div>
    <p>Learning Photoshop was definitely an interesting experience for me.  I feel like I know the basics, and feel comfortable, but 
    because of the sheer amount of things you can do with Photoshop, I don't feel like I know everything.  This makes me worried that
    I don't know everything I can do, but also might just make me hopeful that I can always find something new and interesting to edit
    images.</p>
    <p>I have tried to use Photoshop before, and I tried to learn it in high school, but it never stuck with me.  When first sttempting to
    learn it, I would be overwhelmed by all the options I mentioned before. This time, I was not overwhelmed because I had a goal from 
    the start. Before I had no images to edit, no ideas of what to create, but for this class I actually had the sample ads and the 
    ideas of what to do, so I knew exactly what to look for.</p>
    <p>Those ideas at first were hard to come by still, however.  I had to take quite a while to think of the idea to make it about a
    ghost.  As the assignments went on, though, I became more and more creative with my ideas of what to create: I used help for the
    poster genre change, had a few ideas for the storyboards, and lots of ideas for the logos.  With my creativity, I was also just 
    getting better at Photoshop with practice. The movie poster was a group effort so I will not claim full credit on how it turned out,
    but I am really proud of my Pitt logos.</p>
    <p>I feel like the logos assignment was my favorite this time, as not only was that when I felt most confident, but it also allowed me
    to try out the simple or minimalist aesthetic, which fits not only with my hopes for this website, but my personal tastes.  As I
    explain on the Logos page, I went through several stages to create what I thought would be a fitting logo, and I do really like each
    individual stage, not just the last.</p>
    <p>I also used this oppurtunity to learn more about formatting this website, as an extension of the web design section.  For my Pecha
    Kucha Presentation, I had to learn how to embed the slideshow itself into the page, and not just link to it like I had been doing.
    Speaking of my Pecha Kucha, I used the design principle I learned about through it, <em>Chunking</em>, to format some of the 
    Photoshopped images on their respective pages.  I used chunking o two pages: the Storyboard and Logos pages.  For the storyboard, it
    is set up in two images, but the3 second is just the continuation of the first, so there was no need to separate them. It of course
    looks much better to the eye to have them beside each other. Similarly, the logos are all extensions of the same idea, and so I 
    decided to keep them all in the same line.  This was also something that I had to learn with HTML, as if you try to center an image
    using the block display, they are not inline, and if you make them inline, they are by default left-aligned, and therefore 
    uncentered.  I learned to get around this by creating a div class specifically for holding images, letting the images take on the
    inline display while the div forces them into being centered.</p>
    <p>Again speaking of the Pecha Kucha Presentation, I tried to think ahead and use a Google Slides theme that was darker and not very
    colorful so that when I did manage to embed it it would still fit somewhat with the theme of the overall website.<br>
    Finally, I of course had to add the checklist at the bottom of the Home <i>About Me</i> page, in order to keep track of progress
    throughout the rest of this online semester.  This was yet another HTML element I had to learn of, as so far I have had no
    experience with tables.  After learning the basics, I again tried to make it fit more with the website than just using the basic
    form of the table.  The change wasn't much, but I believe it worked out well.
