    <div><h2>Logo Design</h2></div>
    <p>For our fourth and final photoshop design assignment, the class was asked to create or redesign a logo for some brand,
    whether fictional or nonfictional.<br>
    I decided to create a new logo for the University of Pittsburgh, because the current official seal logo doesn't look modern, and
    I personally don't care for the sports Pitt Panthers logogs.  I decided that other than the Panthers, the most recognizable signal
    of Pitt is of course the Cathedral of Learning, so I decided to use that as the basis for my logos.<br>
    For the first try, I simply decided to have the Cathedral in its natural colors, coming out against the sky-blue circle.  Next,
    I decided to recolor the Cathedral in gold, meaning beside the blue it represents Pitt's team colors, and thus represents Pitt
    even better.  Finally, in order to achieve the <q>modern</q> look that I was aiming for, I decided to make the Cathedral more 
    minimalist, adding another color to keep the shadow.</p>
