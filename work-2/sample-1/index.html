    <div><h2>Ad Expections</h2></div>
    <p>For our first assignment to learn about and get used to photoshop, we were given advertisement examples and told 
      to re-imagine them, whether through a redesign or a parody.<br>
      For my first attempt, I simply redesigned it, and cleaned it up to fix the printing erros present in the original image.
      I redesigned it by simply cutting out unnecessary white space, and bringing the two focuses, the woman and the text,
      closer together.</p>

    <p>For the second attempt, I decided to try a parody.  Given the oold style of the dress (as it was an old ad), I thought of
     making the new advertisement appear to market towards ghosts.  I changed the text oval to include "FOR GHOSTS" and some new
      text, and then removed
      the plain background to replace it with a <em>spooky</em> mansion.  I also isolated the woman's showing skin, and made it
     more transparent, and her whole body a white shine, to make her appear as a ghost.</p>
